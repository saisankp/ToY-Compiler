# Compiler Design
This repository contains my code for the ToY Compiler Project assignment for CSU33071 (Compiler Design I) at Trinity College Dublin. I have made a parser and type-checker for the language ToY. The implementation is made in Java using the tools JFlex and Bison. The language ToY is a simple imperative language with procedures and has many similarities with many similarities with C. You can learn more about ToY [here][here].

# How the project works
Input is tokenized by the lexer during the lexical analysis stage. This is done by the `ToY.l` file. These tokens are passed to the bison parser during the parsing stage. This is done by the `ToY.y` file. There is an abstract syntax tree made out of the tokens. This will reinforce the particular layout of a ToY program. If a token is encountered, we use a symbol table to keep track of variables/dealing with redeclaration/variable types. This is done by the `SymbolTable.java` file. For structs, it can be a bit more tricky, as they can link to other structs. Hence, we make Struct objects for the symbol table whenever we encounter a struct. This is done with the help of the `Struct.java` file.

# How to compile the project
Compiling the code is easy with the Makefile. Just do:

```
make
```

# How to run the project with an input text file
Testing the code with a test file is easy using the Makefile. Just do:

```
make test filename="filenamePath.txt"
```

# How to access the test suite
I have made pre-made test files in our testing suite which we have added along the development of this project to claim more partial marks in the case when our compiler has errors. These can be found in the `/testsuite` directory. Inside this directory, there are two more directories called `/ERROR` and `/VALID`. The `/ERROR` directory contains tests which **should fail**. The `/VALID` directory contains tests which **should not fail**. These tests are rigourous and ensure that our parser/type-checker is as correct as we can make it. To run one of our test files, you could do:

```
make test filename="testsuite/VALID/complexStructUsageLinkingWithOtherStructs.txt"
```

# How to clean all the classes after compiling the code
After you run `make`, a lot of classes will be made in the directory. You can simply remove these when you are finished by doing:
```
make clean
```
